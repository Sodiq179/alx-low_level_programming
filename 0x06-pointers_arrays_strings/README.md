#More pointers, arrays, and strings

*Requirements*
- Language: C

- OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

- Compiler: gcc 4.8.4

*Style guidelines*: Betty style

###Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX Software Engineering Program. The goal is to learn about pointers. arrays, and strings in C programming language.

###Concepts to be learned in this repository:

- pointers
- arrays
- strings

###Description of what each file does

*0* function that concatenates two strings

*1* function that returns and concatenates n bytes of another string

*2* function that returns and copies n bytes of a string and fills '\0' till end of n bytes

*3* function that compares two strings and returns a number re distance of values

*4* function that reverses the content of an array of integers

*5* function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase

*6* function that capitalizes first letter of all words of a string

*7* function that encodes a string into 1337 (leet)

###ADVANCE TASK

*8* function that encodes a string using rot13

*9* function that prints an integer

*10* modify set code so program prints a[2] = 98 under certain constraints

*11* function that adds two numbers

*12* function that prints a buffer.
